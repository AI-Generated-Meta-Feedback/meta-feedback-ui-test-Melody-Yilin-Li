### I chose Bubble sort because it is stable and can easily compare the shelf number and order number of each book. 
### Bubble sort is stable and the stability ensures that the books on the same shelf are in the order they were returned. 

## 2
### When comparing two books, the smaller shelf number comes first, and then the smaller order number comes earlier when two books have the same shelf number. 
### We decide their order based on their order number, from smaller to larger. 
### Comparison rule: shelf number, order number 

## 3
### Time complexity is O(25^2) because we need to make 25 + 24 + 23 + ... + 1 comparisons in total. 
### This will not change as we still need to compare their order number on each shelf.
